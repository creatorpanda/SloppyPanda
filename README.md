***Please read! It may be harmful!! I can't know what may happen!! Don't blame me if things get nasty!!!***

This is a batch file that **STARTS** it self repeatedly, and the called "clones" run themselves too -and so on, until RAM "gets tired" and the computer freezes, or barely moves. The situation becomes almost(?) immposible to handle!



It's also a good idea not to mess with your friends, relatives ~~and enemies~~ by using this program.. Just study the code, thats the whole point!

You can **run it at your own risk** after closing every running program and/or saving any unsaved activity like compilers, notepads, video editors etc so you don't lose anything **BUT I WOUDLN'T RECOMMEND IT!!**



In case you don't know what to do: Click on the green "Clone or Download" button, click "Download Zip". Unzip it and ~~run "FreeCandy.bat"~~  may God help us all..
