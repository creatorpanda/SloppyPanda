***Please read! It may be harmful!! I can't know what may happen!! Don't blame me if things get nasty!!!***

*"Oops! A panda tripped on your RAM's workbench! Spilt coconut juice is everywhere!"*


This is a batch file that **STARTS** itself repeatedly, and the called "clones" run themselves too -and so on, until RAM "gets tired" and the computer freezes, or barely moves. The situation becomes almost(?) impossible to handle!

It's also a good idea not to mess with your friends, relatives ~~and enemies~~ by using this program.. Just study the code, that's the whole point!

*I personally tested the file on one of my school's computers (shhhh..) and things turned bad quickly: A few seconds later, **the PC froze** and the only available option was to shut it down by pressing the power button. When I turned it back on, it proceeded to an **error recovery operation** and afterwards to a **defragmentation**.*

You can **run it at your own risk** after closing every running program and/or saving any unsaved activity like compilers, notepads, video editors etc so you don't lose anything **BUT I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT!!** You can also click [**HERE**](https://github.com/creatorpanda/SloppyPanda/blob/master/SloppyPanda.bat) to read the code online and totally safely.

**Note that:**

1) Renaming the file will ruin the loop command! Leave the file the way it is or rename it **AND** change the 
***START SloppyPanda.bat*** line to 
*START [name you selected].bat*

2) Ruining someone's day/PC is not cool and potentially illegal..

In case you don't know what to do: Click on the green "Clone or Download" button, click "Download Zip". Unzip it, ~~run "SloppyPanda.bat"~~  right click on the file and press **Edit** so you see the source code.
